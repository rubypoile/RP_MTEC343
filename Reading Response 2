Things I knew:
a) The process behind electronic music ensembles in the realm of experimental and freeform music composition, including the possible interplay and improvisation between each individual performer in the ensemble
b) Even the way in which hardware instruments are created and how their parameters are labeled can express a rigid structure in which one is forced to exist within, enforcing both a prescribed functionality and terminology.

Things I did not know:
a) I hadn't made the connection before between radical democratization and the ways in which network music is carried out, and I think this connection might help me be a bit more intentional in my efforts here.
b) I hadn't made the connection between rigid hierarchy in acoustic ensemble music before and how similar it is to an oppressive force at times. That being said, I definitely felt this internally before, but never
had the words to express it verbally.
